On a quiet serene evening the Cosmic Space Patrol sets out for
the usual night cruise through the boulevatds of space. This
beat was always the same; calm, no action and no excitement. 
For some reason this night feels different. 
Shortly before 0200 hours some form of intergalactic material 
is sighted throught the visual particle counter. The material 
is too large a mass to measure. It's drifting closer. 
Lookout, it's a giant asteroid boulder and it's headed straight
for the Cosmic Spacecraft. 
The only chance for survival is to dodge the boulder or destroy it. 
Destroying it doesn't mean just breaking it up, it means
vapourizing it. Small asteroids are equally as fatal as large ones.
Whew, the boulder just missed colliding with the Cosmic Spacecraft,
but suddenly the Cosmic Space Patrol find themselves surrounded by 
thousands of the deadly asteroids. The Cosmic Space Patrol must 
act quickly to save their spacecraft and spare their lives. 
The spacecraft is equipped with photon torpedos, hyperspace, shields 
and bombs.
The Cosmic Space Patrol is highly trained to handle this situation. 
Could you do as good a job as the Cosmic Space Patrol? 
How would you protect yourself if you were caught in a deadly 
asteroid belt?
This is your big chance to fly throughout the dimensions of space
and fend against asteroids. The longer you survive, 
the more space hazards you'll encounter.
